# Personal Blog Project - Abner Vinaja

## Introduction
This repository contains my code for the first project in [Udacity's Front End Web Developer Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd0011).
This project involves creating a personal blog, and it fulfills the following objectives:
- Build the web pages using HTML, and add styling using CSS.
- Use CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid to set the layouts for web page components.
- Implement responsive web design by including media queries. These adjust the web page layouts in response to different screen, window, and viewport sizes.
