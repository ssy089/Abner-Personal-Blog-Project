	        <h5>Java</h5>
		<p>
		    My first programming language was Java. With Java, I was introduced to object-oriented programming
		    in addition to other programming basics like data types, functions/methods, and control structures.
		    In my Programming I and Programming II courses, I learned how to create classes, superclasses, 
		    abstract classes, and interfaces. I also took my Data Structures course in Java, where I used
		    classes to represent data structures like stacks, queues, linked lists, and graphs. Lastly, I reviewed
		    Java basics during the first half of my Application Programming course, and then learned JavaFX, multithread
		    programming, and other Java concepts in the second half.
	        </p>
		<h5>Python</h5>
		<p>
		    My second programming language was Python. I first learned Python in my Systems Programming course,
		    where I used it to create scripts. The second time I reviewed Python was in my Programming Languages
		    course, where I learned how to use classes, objects, iterators, generators, and SQL in Python. However,
		    I still haven't mastered the use of the aforementioned concepts in Python. Then in my Cloud Computing course,
		    I learned how to use Python with MPI for concurrent programming, and how to use Python with Hadoop and ApacheSpark
		    to process large amounts of data.
		</p>
		<h5>C</h5>
		<p>
		    My third programming language was C. I first learned this programming language in my Systems Programming course
		    in order to use its low-level functions for I/O, process control, and interprocess communication. Additional low-level C
		    functions that are used with Unix/Linux were taught to me in my Operating Systems course. These included Pthreads, mutex locks,
		    semaphores, and signals. The last time I worked with C was in my Parallel Programming course, where I practiced using C
		    to implement parallel programming frameworks like OpenMP, MPI, and Pthreads.

		    <br>
		    From a young age, I found myself interested in computers and the internet, 
		    as they are among the most influential innovations of modern society. As I proceeded 
		    through college, I found my strongest interests in software engineering, cloud 
		    computing, and web development. Upon graduation, I plan on pursuing a career in web development, 
		    first as a front-end web developer, and eventually as a full-stack web developer.
