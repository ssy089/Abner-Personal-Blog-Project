	        <h4>Java</h4>
		<p>
		    My first programming language was <strong>Java</strong>. With Java, I was introduced to <strong>object-oriented programming</strong>
		    in addition to other programming basics like data types, functions/methods, and control structures.
		    In my <em>Programming I</em> and <em>Programming II</em> courses, I learned how to create classes, superclasses,
		    abstract classes, and interfaces. I also took my <em>Data Structures</em> course in Java, where I used
		    classes to represent data structures like stacks, queues, linked lists, and graphs. Lastly, I reviewed
		    Java basics during the first half of my <em>Application Programming</em> course, and then learned JavaFX, multithread
		    programming, and other Java concepts in the second half.
	        </p>
		<h4>Python</h4>
		<p>
		    My second programming language was <strong>Python</strong>. I first learned Python in my <em>Systems Programming</em> course,
		    where I used it to create scripts. The second time I reviewed Python was in my <em>Programming Languages</em>
		    course, where I learned how to use classes, objects, iterators, generators, and SQL in Python. However,
		    I still haven't mastered the use of the aforementioned concepts in Python. Then in my <em>Cloud Computing</em> course,
		    I learned how to use Python with <strong>MPI</strong> for concurrent programming, and how to use Python with <strong>Hadoop</strong> and <strong>ApacheSpark</strong>
		    to process large amounts of data.
		</p>
		<h4>C</h4>
		<p>
		    My third programming language was <strong>C</strong>. I first learned this programming language in my <em>Systems Programming</em> course
		    in order to use its low-level functions for I/O, process control, and interprocess communication. Additional low-level C
		    functions that are used with <strong>Unix/Linux</strong> were taught to me in my <em>Operating Systems</em> course. These included Pthreads, mutex locks,
		    semaphores, and signals. The last time I worked with C was in my <em>Parallel Programming</em> course, where I practiced using C
		    to implement parallel programming frameworks like OpenMP, MPI, and Pthreads.

		    <br>
		    From a young age, I found myself interested in computers and the internet,
		    as they are among the most influential innovations of modern society. As I proceeded
		    through college, I found my strongest interests in software engineering, cloud
		    computing, and web development. Upon graduation, I plan on pursuing a career in web development,
		    first as a front-end web developer, and eventually as a full-stack web developer.
